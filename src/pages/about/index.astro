    <h2 class='text-center'>Code with Purpose, Communication without Barriers</h2>
    <p class='text-center'>
      At the heart of digital innovation, where code meets human experience,
      Sign Language Tech was born. We were founded by two Deaf software
      engineers with a shared vision: to build a digital future that is not just
      functional, but fundamentally accessible to everyone.
    </p>
    <p class='text-center'>
      Our identity isn't just a feature; it's our greatest strength. As members
      of the Deaf community, we live and breathe accessibility. We understand
      firsthand the barriers that non-inclusive design can create, and more
      importantly, we see the incredible opportunity that accessible technology
      offers to connect people.
    </p>
    <p class='text-center'>
      This unique perspective is embedded in every line of code we write, every
      solution we architect, and every project we deliver. We don’t add
      accessibility as an afterthought; we build it from the core.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      Our mission is simple: to create exceptional software solutions that
      empower users. We specialize in cloud-native software services and web
      application development, driven by an unwavering commitment to quality,
      innovation, and universal digital accessibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Values</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Empathy-Driven Innovation:</strong> We solve complex problems
        with elegant tech solutions that put the end-user first.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quality by Design:</strong> We believe that accessible software
        is inherently better software—more robust, usable, and scalable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seamless Collaboration:</strong> We foster direct, frictionless
        communication, ensuring our clients' vision is perfectly translated into
        the final product.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Community:</strong> We are committed to giving back, creating
        tools and opportunities that open doors within the tech world.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>At Sign Language Tech, we don’t just build software. We build bridges.</p>
